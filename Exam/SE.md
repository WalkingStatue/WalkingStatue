**Chapter 1**

*Software can be described as a collection of
instruction that are executed to get desired
functionalities.

Software is made-up of
-instructions provide desired function and performance
-data structures manipulate information
-documents use of the programs


*Types of Software

■ system software
■ application software
■ engineering/scientific software
■ embedded software
■ product-line software (word
processing, spread sheet)
■ WebApps (Web applications)
■ AI software (solve better than
human)
■ Open world computing
■ Netsourcing
■ Open source


*Characteristics of Software

􀀀 Not “Manufactured” in the Classical Sense
􀀀 A logical rather than physical system element
􀀀 Invisibility
􀀀 Does Not “Wear-Out”
􀀀 Invariably Custom-Built
􀀀 Has reusable components
􀀀 Flexible


*Software Engineering

IEEE Definition
“A Systematic Approach to the Development,
Operation, Maintenance and Retirement of
Software, where Software is Computer
Programs, Procedures, Rules and Associated
Documents and Data pertaining to the Operation
of a Computer System.”


*Software Engineering Layers

■ Engg. Approach must rest on quality
■ Process manage and control s/w projects and
delivery of quality work products
■ Method provide technical how-to’s for
communication, requirements analysis, design
modeling, program construction, testing …
■ Tools provide automated and semi automated
support for the process and methods


*The Software Process

Software Process is the Collection of Activities ,Actions
and Tasks , that are performed when some work
product is to be created

A process frame work establishes the foundation for a
complete software engineering process by identifying a
small number of a framework activities , applicable to all
software project , regardless of size, complexity


*Process Framework Activities

■ Communication-Communicate with stakeholders and
customers
■ Planning
■ Modeling
■ Construction
■ Deployment
