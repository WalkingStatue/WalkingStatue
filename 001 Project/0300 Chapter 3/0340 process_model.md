For our system we are going to use Incremental Model.

**Incremental Model**

The incremental model is a software development process model that divides the development of a system into small, manageable parts, or increments. Each increment represents a portion of the overall system's functionality and is developed separately.

In this model, development occurs in a series of iterations, with each iteration adding new features or enhancing existing ones. At the end of each iteration, a working subset of the system is produced, which can be tested and reviewed. This allows for early feedback, making it easier to accommodate changes and improvements throughout the development process.

The incremental model is beneficial for complex projects, as it enables the team to prioritize and focus on specific features or modules, reducing the risk of project failure and making it more adaptable to changing requirements. It is particularly useful when the full project scope is not entirely clear at the beginning.

Overall, the incremental model promotes flexibility, collaboration, and rapid development while ensuring that the system is functional at the end of each increment, which can be especially valuable in dynamic and evolving software development environments.

**Advantages of Incremental Model**

·       Early Delivery: Clients receive a working product incrementally, allowing them to use and benefit from the system's partial functionality sooner.

·       Flexibility: It accommodates changing requirements more effectively because new features can be added in subsequent iterations.

·       Reduced Risk: Smaller, manageable increments reduce the risk of project failure since issues can be identified and addressed early.

·       Better Testing: Testing and quality assurance can be more focused and thorough on specific increments, leading to higher product quality.

·       Client Involvement: Clients can provide feedback during the development process, resulting in a system that better meets their needs.

·       Easier Maintenance: Since the system is developed incrementally, it is typically easier to maintain and adapt over time.

·       Parallel Development: Different teams can work on different increments simultaneously, improving productivity.

**Disadvantages of Incremental Model**

·       Management Complexity: Managing multiple increments and coordinating their integration can be challenging and may increase project management overhead.

·       Dependency Management: Dependencies between different increments can lead to issues if not managed properly.

·       Design Constraints: Decisions made in early increments may limit options for subsequent ones, potentially leading to suboptimal design choices.

·       Costly Integration: Integrating multiple increments can be time-consuming and expensive, particularly if not well-planned.

·       Client Availability: Requires consistent client involvement and feedback, which may not always be feasible.

·       Documentation Overhead: Each increment may require separate documentation, increasing paperwork.

·       Not Ideal for Small Projects: The incremental model may add unnecessary complexity for small, well-defined projects with stable requirements.
