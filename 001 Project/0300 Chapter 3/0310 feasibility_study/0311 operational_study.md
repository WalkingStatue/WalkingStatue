·       The operational feasibility of a finance management app depends on a number of factors, such as the availability of qualified developers, the ability to attract and retain users, and the ability to provide customer support.

·       Qualified developers are available, but the demand for qualified developers is high. This means that it may be necessary to pay a premium to attract and retain top talent.

·       Attracting and retaining users will require a well-designed and marketed app. The app should also be regularly updated with new features and bug fixes.

·       Providing customer support is important for any app, but it is especially important for a finance management app. Users need to be able to trust that the app is secure and that their data is protected. They also need to be able to get help if they have any problems with the app.
