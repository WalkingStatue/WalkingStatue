**Relationships:**

- **User** can have multiple **Transactions** (both Income and Expense). This is a one-to-many relationship between User and Transaction.
- **Transaction** is the superclass for both **Income** and **Expense** classes, representing a generalization relationship.
- **Transaction** is associated with **Category** to classify the transaction, representing an association relationship.
- **Budget** is also associated with **Category** to set budget limits for specific categories.

Remember, this is a basic design. Depending on the app's specific features and requirements, you might need more classes, attributes, methods, and relationships. For example, if you're incorporating bank integration, there may be another class for "BankAccount" or "BankIntegration". Always tailor the class diagram to fit the specific needs and features of your application.
