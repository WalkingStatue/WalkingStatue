**Q1**
Cybercrimes encompass a broad range of activities, which can be facilitated through various techniques:

1. **Phishing**:
    
    - **Description**: Phishing involves sending deceptive emails that appear to be from a trusted source in order to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
    - **Real-life example**: The **2016 U.S. Democratic National Committee email leak** was partially initiated by a phishing scheme. John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, was deceived into clicking a malicious link that gave hackers access to his email account.
2. **Ransomware**:
    
    - **Description**: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files. The attacker then demands a ransom from the victim to restore access to the data.
    - **Real-life example**: The **WannaCry** ransomware attack of 2017 affected more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries, including major institutions like the UK’s National Health Service, encrypting data and demanding Bitcoin payments.
3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**:
    
    - **Description**: During an MITM attack, the attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties without their knowledge.
    - **Real-life example**: In 2011, **Iran reportedly conducted an MITM attack** against the Dutch certificate authority DigiNotar, enabling the issuance of fraudulent SSL certificates and subsequent eavesdropping on Google users within Iran.
4. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**:
    
    - **Description**: In DDoS attacks, multiple compromised computers are used to flood a target system, rendering it inoperable.
    - **Real-life example**: In 2016, the **Dyn DNS DDoS attack** caused major internet platforms and services to become unavailable to large swathes of users in Europe and North America. Major websites like Twitter, Netflix, and Reddit were affected.
**Eavesdropping and Surveillance**:
     **Description**: Unauthorized interception of information, like listening to communications or capturing computer activities.
     **Real-life example**: The **Stuxnet worm**, discovered in 2010, was used to spy on and disrupt Iran’s nuclear enrichment plans.
2. **Cryptojacking**:
- **Description**: It involves unauthorized use of someone else’s computer to mine cryptocurrency.
- **Real-life example**: In 2017 and 2018, a spike in **cryptojacking attacks** was observed where websites secretly used browser scripts like Coinhive to mine Monero cryptocurrency using visitors' computing resources.
