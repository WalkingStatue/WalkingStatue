**Q1**
Cybercrimes encompass a broad range of activities, which can be facilitated through various techniques:

1. **Phishing**:
    
    - **Description**: Phishing involves sending deceptive emails that appear to be from a trusted source in order to trick recipients into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers.
    - **Real-life example**: The **2016 U.S. Democratic National Committee email leak** was partially initiated by a phishing scheme. John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, was deceived into clicking a malicious link that gave hackers access to his email account.
2. **Ransomware**:
    
    - **Description**: Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files. The attacker then demands a ransom from the victim to restore access to the data.
    - **Real-life example**: The **WannaCry** ransomware attack of 2017 affected more than 200,000 computers across 150 countries, including major institutions like the UK’s National Health Service, encrypting data and demanding Bitcoin payments.
3. **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks**:
    
    - **Description**: During an MITM attack, the attacker secretly intercepts and possibly alters the communication between two parties without their knowledge.
    - **Real-life example**: In 2011, **Iran reportedly conducted an MITM attack** against the Dutch certificate authority DigiNotar, enabling the issuance of fraudulent SSL certificates and subsequent eavesdropping on Google users within Iran.
4. **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)**:
    
    - **Description**: In DDoS attacks, multiple compromised computers are used to flood a target system, rendering it inoperable.
    - **Real-life example**: In 2016, the **Dyn DNS DDoS attack** caused major internet platforms and services to become unavailable to large swathes of users in Europe and North America. Major websites like Twitter, Netflix, and Reddit were affected.
**Eavesdropping and Surveillance**:
     **Description**: Unauthorized interception of information, like listening to communications or capturing computer activities.
     **Real-life example**: The **Stuxnet worm**, discovered in 2010, was used to spy on and disrupt Iran’s nuclear enrichment plans.
2. **Cryptojacking**:
- **Description**: It involves unauthorized use of someone else’s computer to mine cryptocurrency.
- **Real-life example**: In 2017 and 2018, a spike in **cryptojacking attacks** was observed where websites secretly used browser scripts like Coinhive to mine Monero cryptocurrency using visitors' computing resources.

**Q2**
**Cyber Forensic**

**Introduction**: Cyber forensic, also known as digital forensic, is the scientific examination and analysis of data held on, or retrieved from, electronic storage media in such a way that the information can be used as evidence in a court of law. It encompasses various areas including computer forensics, network forensics, mobile device forensics, and cloud forensics.

**Main Components**:

1. **Data Collection**:
    
    - The initial phase where evidence is identified, labeled, recorded, and collected from digital sources. Care is taken to ensure no data is altered, deleted, or tampered with.
    - **Example**: In the **2009 Bernie Madoff case**, investigators collected vast amounts of electronic data, including emails and account records, to ascertain the extent of the financial fraud.
2. **Data Examination**:
    
    - Using specialized tools and techniques, investigators uncover relevant data. This could involve retrieving deleted files, accessing formatted drives, or decrypting protected data.
    - **Example**: In the investigation of the **Enron scandal**, millions of emails were examined to understand the fraudulent activities of the company.
3. **Data Analysis**:
    
    - Here, the context is provided to the data. Investigators piece together digital evidence to reconstruct potential crimes or security breaches.
    - **Example**: During the **Sony Pictures hack of 2014**, forensic experts analyzed malware, logs, and other digital traces to attribute the attack to North Korean hackers.
4. **Documentation and Reporting**:
    
    - Investigators document every step of their process, ensuring that a chain of custody is maintained. Reports are generated to detail findings, methodologies, and conclusions.
    - **Example**: After the **Target data breach in 2013**, forensic reports detailed how attackers gained entry through an HVAC vendor and moved laterally to access payment systems.
5. **Presentation**:
    
    - If a case goes to court, forensic experts may be called to present their findings and testify as expert witnesses.
    - **Example**: In the **case against Gary McKinnon**, who was accused of hacking into 97 U.S. military and NASA computers, digital forensic experts presented evidence of his illicit activities.
6. **Data Recovery**:
    
    - Techniques used to retrieve data that might have been deleted, corrupted, or made inaccessible.
    - **Example**: After the **7/7 bombings in London**, forensic experts managed to recover data from damaged mobile devices of victims to aid the investigation.
7. **Network Analysis**:
    
    - Analyzing logs and traffic to detect intrusions, malware infections, or unauthorized access.
    - **Example**: The **WannaCry ransomware attack** in 2017 was analyzed by forensic experts to determine its origin and propagation methods.

**Challenges**:

- Rapid technological advancements mean forensic tools and techniques must constantly evolve.
- Encrypted data can pose challenges for retrieval and analysis.
- Maintaining the integrity of data is critical for it to be admissible in court.

**Conclusion**: Cyber forensic is a pivotal discipline in today's digital age, helping law enforcement and organizations understand and address threats, ensuring that justice is served. The use of real-life examples and case studies emphasizes its significance and application in solving high-profile cyber-related cases.
